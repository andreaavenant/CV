  <p>I am a engineering graduate from Stellenbosch University in South Africa.
    My industrial engineering degree has given me the necessary skill-set to
    solve complex problems on a technical, creative and analytical level.
    Throughout my studies and my experience in product development, I have
    discovered that I have a passion for futurology and questioning the
    ‘status quo’. For these reasons I enjoy being on the forefront of new
    technology and developments. I believe knowledge is power, and lifelong
    learning and skill development is what will drive my generation.</p>
  <p>I am adaptable, thrive in a fast-paced and ever-changing environment
    and constantly aim to be involved in new challenges. I am reliable,
    accurate and curious. With information freely available and accessible to
    everyone in modern society; I believe it is not about knowing all the
    answers, but rather about asking the right questions.</p>
